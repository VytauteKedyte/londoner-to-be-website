# londoner-to-be-website
A website to help Londoners-to-be to choose where to live

This is a project undertaken by Clare, Rachel, Shirley and VK as part of the Code First: Girls beginner course in Spring 2018.

The purpose of the website is to help people who are planning to move to London but have either not been here before or simply do not know it well enough to be able to confidently choose a neighbourhood to live in.

The website provides the user with the ability to specify their criteria, which are used to query a database containing publicly available data, and come up with a shortlist of neighbourhoods that meet the user's requirements best.
